<h1>The Best Movies According to Julia</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Eurovision</h3>
<p>This film just makes me laugh so much. Will and Amanda have captured the spirit of the competition and how the various countries behave in it so well. A real tonge in cheek poke and the competition. It has some great actors in it</p>

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>I came out of seeing this film wanting to go back in and see it all over again. At the time it was ground breaking and you saw in films that followed how they had used elements of the film in theirs like the slow bullet action. This film left me with so many questions and I think the cast were excellent.</p>

<h3>E.T</h3>
<p>This is the first film I remeber seeing at the cinema and I cried all the way home. At the time of making it, it was also groundbreaking (like The Matrix, but decades earlier). It was a beautiful story of friendship. </p>
